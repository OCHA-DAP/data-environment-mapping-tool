# data-environment-mapping-tool
Visualise a network of HDX datasets related to a country or tag and the variables (column headers) they share.

This tool allows the user to visualise some aspects of the data environment by finding related data from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) and identifying potential key variables, those variables shared across datasets that may be useful for record linkage.

The main features of the tool are:

•download data from HDX or use data from specified local folder

•extract variable names (column headers) and HXLs from datasets

•compare variables between all pairs of datasets and identify common variables

•apply  weights  defined  by  expert  judgement  to  particularly  high/low  risk  variables(optional)

•visualise all datasets and their relationships using a network

•update network in real-time and clearly display relationships when new data addedthrough a user-interface.
